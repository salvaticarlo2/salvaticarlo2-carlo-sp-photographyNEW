# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Optimized Files for Deployment

I've prepared the following enhanced files that are optimized for Vercel deployment:

1. `/src/app/globals.css` - Enhanced global styles
2. `/src/app/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - Improved navigation with workshop links removed
3. `/src/app/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Enhanced footer with workshop links removed
4. `/src/app/page.tsx` - Redesigned homepage with workshop section removed
5. `/src/app/components/InstagramFeed.tsx` - Enhanced Instagram feed component
6. `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated layout with proper font configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Your Current Files**
   - Before making any changes, create backups of your current files

2. **Replace Files**
   - Replace each file in your project with the enhanced version
   - Ensure the file paths match exactly

3. **Verify Font Configuration**
   - Make sure the font imports in layout.tsx are properly configured
   - Verify that the font variables are correctly applied

4. **Test Locally**
   - Run `npm run dev` to test the site locally before deployment
   - Check all pages and responsive behavior

5. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Commit your changes to your repository
   - Push to your connected Git repository
   - Vercel should automatically deploy the updated site

## Vercel-Specific Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - All images use the Next.js Image component for optimal loading
   - Placeholder gradients are used where actual images aren't available

2. **Code Structure**
   - Component structure is maintained for compatibility
   - Import/export patterns match the original code

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - CSS is organized for efficient loading
   - Animations are hardware-accelerated where possible
   - Font loading is optimized with proper display settings

4. **Metadata**
   - SEO metadata has been updated to remove workshop references
   - OpenGraph and Twitter card information is preserved

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify that all file paths are correct
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Check that font imports are working correctly

The enhanced design maintains compatibility with your existing Vercel deployment setup while providing significant visual improvements.
