## Testing Setup

I've created a test environment with the following structure:
- Proper directory structure following Next.js conventions
- Configured fonts (Playfair Display, Raleway, Montserrat)
- Updated metadata to remove workshop references
- Set up proper Tailwind configuration

## Vercel Deployment Considerations

For successful deployment on Vercel:
- The enhanced files maintain the same import/export structure as the originals
- Component naming conventions are preserved
- No additional dependencies were introduced
- The file structure matches the original project

## Implementation Notes

1. To implement these changes in your project:
   - Replace the existing files with the enhanced versions
   - Ensure the font imports in layout.tsx are properly configured
   - Test locally before deploying to Vercel

2. The design improvements focus on:
   - Creating a more sophisticated, minimalist aesthetic
   - Putting photography at the forefront
   - Improving typography and spacing
   - Adding subtle animations and transitions
   - Ensuring responsive design across all devices

All workshop-related content has been removed as requested, and the design has been enhanced to match the aesthetic of andymumford.com while maintaining your existing code structure for smooth Vercel deployment.
