## Implementation Notes

1. The color scheme prioritizes the photography by using neutral backgrounds that don't compete with images
2. Accent colors are drawn from landscape photography elements (earth, foliage, sky/water)
3. High contrast between text and backgrounds ensures readability
4. Consistent application of colors will maintain brand identity across all pages
5. Color usage should be minimal and purposeful, allowing photographs to be the focal point
6. Dark mode will be the default, with light mode as an option
