## Design Rationale
The logo design balances professionalism with artistic sensibility, reflecting Carlo SP's approach to landscape photography. The mountain/horizon motif connects directly to the subject matter while the typography choices convey elegance and timelessness. The minimalist approach ensures the logo won't compete with the photography itself but will provide a consistent brand identity across all platforms.
